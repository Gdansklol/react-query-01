 [Create React App with React Query]
 Doc : (https://refine.dev/blog/react-query-guide/#introduction).

## Introduction
* What is React Query?

This is a library that supports fetching, caching, and synchronization with server data.
There is no need for complex and lengthy code, and you can use the API simply and intuitively inside the React Component.

* Why use React Queries?

Libraries for state management in React include redux and recoil, which often manage client state and server state together.

In addition, by using various options, previously inconvenient things such as caching, error handling, suspense, refresh, and data fetching condition settings can be used declaratively and easily.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
